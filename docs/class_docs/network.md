# Network

[Back to central documentation](../documentation.md)

Trainable predictor with user-defined structure.

Components (activation functions, layers, branching structure...) are added one at a time.

After building the desired architecture, the network must be enabled through the `enable` method to train it.
To be enabled, a network must have a loss calculator, optimizer, and at least one layer.
The `disable` method allows the network to be modified again.

A network can have at most 2 billion components.

---

### Constructor

*Signature:* `Network()`

Creates a new, empty network.

The new network is not enabled, with no components, loss calculator, or optimizer.

---

### Getters

#### active_branch_ids

*Signature:* `std::unordered_set<int32_t> active_branch_ids() const`

Returns the set of valid branch IDs in the network.

A valid branch ID is one that can be added to.
Branches that have been merged (and thus permanently terminated) are not included in the output.

**Returns**
* `std::unordered_set<int32_t>`: All valid branch IDs.

---

#### is_enabled

*Signature:* `bool is_enabled() const`

Returns whether the network is ready for training and optimization.

**Returns**

* `bool`: Whether the network is enabled.

---

### Setters

#### add_combiner

*Signature:* `void add_combiner(std::initializer_list<int32_t> branch_ids_to_combine, int32_t branch_id = 0, std::source_location loc = std::source_location::current())`

Adds a combiner, merging the branch IDs given in `branch_ids_to_combine`, to branch `branch_id`.

If `branch_id` is negative, at least the total number of branches used so far, or corresponds to a branch that has been merged, this method throws `cast::bad_component_addition`.

`cast::bad_component_addition` is also thrown if any of the branch IDs in `branch_ids_to_combine` is out of the range [0, <number of branches used in the network - 1>], has already been merged, or equals `branch_id` (combiners cannot merge their own branch).

A Combiner cannot be the first component added to a network.

To use this method, the network cannot be enabled. 

**Parameters**

* `branch_ids_to_combine` (`std::initializer_list<int32_t>`): List of branch IDs to merge. Non-empty.
* `branch_id` (`int32_t`): Branch to add the new combiner to.
* `loc` (`std::source_location`): Location where this method is called (for debugging purposes).

**Exceptions**

* `cast::bad_network_config`: Thrown if the network is enabled.
* `cast::bad_component_addition`: Thrown if `branch_id` is negative, out of range, or already combined; if any branch ID to combine is out of range, already combined, or equals `branch_id`; or if attempting to add a combiner as the first component.
* `std::out_of_range`: If more than 2 billion components (operators, splitters, or combiners) have been added to the network.

---

#### add_operator

*Signature:* `void add_operator(std::shared_ptr<Operator> op, int32_t branch_id = 0, std::source_location loc = std::source_location::current())`

Adds `op` to the end of branch `branch_id`.

An operator is a layer or an activation function.

To use this method, the network cannot be enabled.

**Parameters**

* `op` (`std::shared_ptr<Operator>`): Operator to add to a branch.
* `branch_id` (`int32_t`): Branch to add the new operator to.
* `loc` (`std::source_location`): Location where this method is called (for debugging purposes).

**Exceptions**

* `cast::bad_network_config`: If the network is enabled.
* `cast::bad_component_addition`: If `branch_id` is negative, out of range, or corresponds to a merged branch.
* `std::out_of_range`: If more than 2 billion components (operators, splitters, or combiners) have been added to the network.

---

#### add_splitter

*Signature:* `void add_splitter(int32_t branch_count, int32_t branch_id = 0, std::source_location loc = std::source_location::current())`

Adds a splitter that distributes execution across `branch_count` new branches, to branch `branch_id`.

To use this method, the network cannot be enabled.

**Parameters**

* `branch_count` (`int32_t`): Number of branches to split execution into. Must be at least 2.
* `branch_id` (`int32_t`): Branch to add the new splitter to.
* `loc` (`std::source_location`): Location where this method is called (for debugging purposes).

**Exceptions**

* `cast::bad_network_config`: If the network is enabled.
* `cast::bad_component_addition`: If `branch_id` is negative, out of range, or corresponds to a merged branch.
* `std::out_of_range`: If more than 2 billion components (operators, splitters, or combiners) have been added to the network.

---

#### disable

*Signature:* `void disable()`

Disables the network.

Prevents training and optimization, but allows the network to be modified.

---

#### enable

*Signature:* `void enable()`

Checks if the network has the necessary components to run.

If not, throws `enable_failed_error`. If so, allows training and optimization.

Enable check: The network must have a loss calculator, optimizer, at least one component, and exactly one output.

**Exceptions**

* `cast::enable_failed_error`: If the enable check fails.

---

#### set_loss_calculator

*Signature:* `void set_loss_calculator(std::shared_ptr<LossCalculator> calc)`

Sets this network's loss calculator to `calc`.

To use this method, the network cannot be enabled.

**Parameters**

* `calc` (`std::shared_ptr<LossCalculator>`): New loss calculator to use. Not equal to `nullptr`.

**Exceptions**

* `cast::bad_network_config`: If the network is enabled.

---

#### set_optimizer

*Signature:* `void set_optimizer(std::shared_ptr<Optimizer> optim)`

Sets this network's optimizer to `optim`.

The pointer to the optimizer can be manipulated from outside the network.

To use this method, the network cannot be enabled.

**Parameters**

* `optim` (`std::shared_ptr<Optimizer>`): New optimizer to use. Not equal to `nullptr`.

**Exceptions**

* `cast::bad_network_config`: If the network is enabled.

---

#### set_optimizer_hyperparams

*Signature:* `void set_optimizer_hyperparams(std::initializer_list<double> new_hyperparams)`

Sets the hyperparameters of the network's optimizer.

The length and preconditions of each element in `new_hyperparams` must match those
in the optimizer's `set_hyperparameters` method.

**Parameters**

* `new_hyperparams` (`std::initializer_list<double>`): New hyperparameters to set.

**Exceptions**

* `cast::bad_network_config`: If the network has no optimizer.

---

### Methods

To use this method, the network must be enabled.

**Parameters**

**Returns**

* `xt::xarray<double>`: Result of the forward pass.

**Exceptions**

#### backward

*Signature:* `void backward(xt::xarray<double> predicted, xt::xarray<double> expected)`

Computes the backward pass, beginning with loss between `predicted` and `expected`.

The network must be enabled to use this method.

**Parameters**

#### optimize

Uses the network's stored optimizer and the gradients computed from the `backward` method.

To use this method, the network must be enabled.

**Parameters**

* `zero_grad` (`bool`): Whether to set all operator's gradients to 0 after computing the optimization pass.

**Exceptions**

* `cast::bad_network_config`: If the network is not enabled.

#### output stream insertion (<<)

*Signature:* `template<typename CharT, typename Traits> friend std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& operator<<(std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& output_stream, const Network& network)`

Exports `network` to the output stream `output_stream`, returning `output_stream` with `network`'s information inside.
